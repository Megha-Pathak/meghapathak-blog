This is my first post on my new blog! How exciting!

I have been actively writing on LinkedIn from the last 2 years. 

Really excited to begin with a Personal Blog now. 
I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

Some of topics this blog will revolve around - 

* Resouces, experiences, suggestions around Web Development and related technologies. 
* Details about some interesting projects that you can use in different areas of your life. 
* About Product Management
* Open Source Projects and Communities 
* How students can create a Personal Brand for themselves. 
* Freelancing tips and how-to guides.
